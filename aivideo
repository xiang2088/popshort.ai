The consistency of characters is the best. Even if the costumes are updated, they are still very consistent. This problem has troubled us for ten months. 10 months ago, we started AI short drama business with a 4090 machine. It is both a challenge and an opportunity, full of unknowns and possibilities. I often work late into the night to rack my brains for a creative inspiration or character consistency problem.

Every attempt and every failure gives me a deeper understanding of AI short dramas. We constantly adjust the direction, optimize the content, and strive to find a balance between technology and creativity. Although this process is difficult, it also makes me deeply appreciate the charm of the integration of technology and art.

10 months ago, one person could only generate one short film a week; 4 months ago, one person generated 1-2 short films a day. Today, a one-click AI short film generation tool was launched. Only one idea is needed to generate dozens of short films in a few minutes. It not only solves the problem of character consistency, but also solves the problem of generating short films.

1 idea, 1 click, 10 short films. Create 10x faster. https://www.popshort.ai/
